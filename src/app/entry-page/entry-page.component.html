        <p class="text">This is a game of memory. A selection of cards are presented to you, face down. You turn over the cards
            two at a time by clicking on them, or using the tab and enter keys on your keyboard. If the cards match, they will
            remain face up. If not, they will turn over again. You have to remember where the cards are in order to match them.
            To win, all the cards need to be matched and therefore face up.<br>
            There are three levels. Beginner has 12 different pairs, Intermediate has 24 different pairs, and Advanced has
            36 different pairs.
